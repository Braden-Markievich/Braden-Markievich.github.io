        <p1>I have listed various assignments and projects I have completed both outside and inside the classroom. For projects from my coursework, I am not posting the files here due to Academic Integrity reasons. If you are interested in viewing them, I have them stored in a private repository on my <a href = 'https://github.com/Braden-Markievich' target='_blank'>GitHub profile</a>.

        <p1>
            CMPSC 132 at Penn State introduces:<br><br>Object-oriented programming (classes, objects, methods, inheritance)<br>Data Structures and Algorithms (Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables)<br>Inroduction to algorithms and complexity (Big O notation)<br>Higher-order functional programming<br><br><span class = 'bold'>Some</span> completed work includes:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>HW3: Create a Stack class that supports stack operations such as pop, peek, push, and isEmpty. Create a Calculator class that takes in an infix notation expression, converts it to a postfix expression, and evaluates the postfix expression using the Stack class. Implied multiplication with parentheses needs to be accounted for in the Calculator class. It must also check whether the expression is valid or not and handle it accordingly.</li><br>
                <li>HW4: Build a cache with three different levels using doubly linked lists being stored in hash tables. Each cache level is a doubly linked list, with items within either being introduced or selected based on various qualities. LRU and MRU eviction policies are implemented to control size of the cache. Maintain proper linked list properties between nodes, along with updating items of the list based on user input.</li><br>
                <li>HW5: Create a MinBinaryHeap class that creates a min binary heap using a list that can delete root, get root's value, and insert elements. Create a PriorityQueue class which orders items within the MinBinaryHeap obejct depending on their priority input. Finally, create a Graph class that utilizes the PriorityQueue class and implement a dijkstra_table method to display the most cost efficient way to get from one node of the heap to another node. </li><br>
            </ul>
